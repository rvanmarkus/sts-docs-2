### Requirements

Before starting the installation, ensure your system(s) meet StackState's [installation requirements](/get_started/installation/requirements/).

### Two-node deployment architecture

To improve the performance of the StackState installation, it can be split over two nodes with each node performing a different function. The first node will run StackState itself, including Kafka and ElasticSearch. The second node will run the StackGraph data store.

### Installing StackState in a two-node configuration

To improve the performance of the StackState installation, it can be split over two nodes with each node performing a different function. The first node will run StackState itself, including Kafka and ElasticSearch. The second node will run the StackGraph data store.

Configure StackState to run in the two-node setup requires the following steps:

#### Preparing the StackGraph node

1. Install the package using the instruction for [Installing StackState](/get_started/installation/install_stackstate).
2. Run `systemctl disable stackstate`
3. Add `Environment=STACKGRAPH_NODE_NAME=<stackgraph-host-name>` to /lib/systemd/system/stackgraph.service
4. Reload systemd daemon: `systemctl daemon-reload`
5. Start the StackGraph process as described in [Starting / Stopping](#starting-and-stopping).

#### Preparing the StackState node

To prepare an additional node for running a StackState component, follow these steps:

1. Install the package using the instruction for [Installing StackState](/get_started/installation/install_stackstate).
2. Run `systemctl disable stackgraph`
3. Modify the provided SystemD configuration files as follows:

  * Edit the file `/lib/systemd/system/stackstate.service`:
    - Remove the `stackgraph.service` from the `Requires` and `After` sections
    - Define the environment variable `ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM` by adding the line `Environment=ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM=<your-stackgraph-server>` under the `[Service]` section, with the hostname of your StackGraph server as the value.
    - Reload systemd daemon: `systemctl daemon-reload`

After these changes the `stackstate.service` file should look approximately like this:

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=StackState System monitor Service
    After=syslog.target network.target

    [Service]
    LimitNOFILE=131072
    Type=forking
    User=stackstate
    Group=stackstate
    PIDFile=/opt/stackstate/var/run/stackstate.pid
    ExecStart=/opt/stackstate/bin/sts-service.sh start
    ExecReload=/opt/stackstate/bin/sts-service.sh reload
    ExecStop=/opt/stackstate/bin/sts-service.sh stop
    Environment=ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM=<your-stackgraph-server>

    [Install]
    Alias=stackstate.service
    WantedBy=multi-user.target```  
    ```
#### Configuring StackState

After you have installed StackState, refer to the following pages for configuration instructions:

* [Configuring StackState](/get_started/installation/configuration/)
* [Configuring authentication](/get_started/installation/authentication/)
* [Reverse Proxy](/get_started/installation/reverse_proxy/)

#### Starting and Stopping

Note that the StackGraph node always needs to be running before starting StackState

#### Starting and Stopping StackGraph

On the StackGraph node, the following commands will start/stop StackGraph:

`sudo systemctl start stackgraph.service`

`sudo systemctl stop stackgraph.service`

#### Starting and Stopping StackState

On the StackState node, the following commands will start/stop StackState:

`sudo systemctl start stackstate.service`

`sudo systemctl stop stackstate.service`
